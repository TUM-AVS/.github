On the github side of the AVS Lab you will find teaching ressources and algorihtms that focuses on the algorithmic foundations of path and behavior planning, control, and continuous learning of autonomous systems. We aim to develop vehicles that will be able to interact with each other and with humans while operating safely, efficiently and powerfully. On Our Github page you find resources for teaching and research. Mostly, you will find the algorithms, tools and simulation we developed to enable safe and trustworthy autonomy for a wide range of highly integrated autonomous vehicle applications.
