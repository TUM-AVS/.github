## Welcome to the Autonomous Vehicle Sysems (AVS) Lab at TUM! ðŸ‘‹

Our AVS Labs research is motivated by the goal of developing the next generation of intelligent autonomous vehicles. We aim to develop autonomous vehicles that will be able to interact with each other and with humans while operating safely, efficiently, and powerfully. On Our Github page you will find resources for teaching and research. Here you will find the algorithms, tools and simulations we developed to enable safe and trustworthy autonomy for a wide range of highly integrated autonomous vehicle applications.
